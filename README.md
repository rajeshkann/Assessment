import required library like Pandas numpy for EDA and matplolib, seaborn for visualization

import required model from its library

Time series analysis on date column for better prediction

Q1-- To find important independent variable for prediction of dependent varible
    
   by find correlation of each column with dependent variable we can get that result
   
        registered, casual, atemp are all high correlated variables with dependent variable
        
Model Selection and Training

Model Evaluation can done by Evaluation Metrics

Linear Regression accuracy and Evaluation Metrics looks good

Q2-- Evaluation Metrics:

    r2_score-- 1.0 
    
    mean_absolute error -- 1.2116213664029764e-12 
    
    mean_squared_error -- 2.071492544278772e-24
